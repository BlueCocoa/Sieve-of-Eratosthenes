# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes with optimization

### Algorithmic complexity
Estimated O(n)?

In short, it takes about 1.5s to pick out all prime numbers in 2 to 400000000 on my MacBook Pro.

See my [blog post](https://blog.0xbbc.com/2016/01/optimum-sieve-of-eratosthenes/) for details. 

### Notice
This is NOT the best optimization for Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
